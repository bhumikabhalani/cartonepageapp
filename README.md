# How to run?
    * npm install
    * npm start

# Design consideration
    * to cache cart information, I did overwrite the setState of cart product list. There, I store entire state in Local Storage and get back from its constructor.
    Note: This is simple one page application with cart product list, product list and app.js as a component. No template or basic website layout setup.
